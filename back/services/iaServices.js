### Constraints:
1. **No overlap**:
   - A teacher cannot teach two classes at the same time.
   - A classroom cannot be used by multiple classes simultaneously.
   - The new scheduled hours must not overlap with existing planned courses for the same teacher or classroom.
   
2. **Respect required hours**:
   - Ensure the total number of hours scheduled for each subject per class matches the required hours as specified in \`subjectClass\`.
   
3. **Respect school weeks**:
   - Schedule \`potentialWorkHours\` only within the days and hours defined in \`schoolWeekClass\` (do not schedule outside these periods).
   - Spread the potential work hours across multiple days based on the available days within the \`schoolWeekClass\`, ensuring that courses are not all generated for the same day.
   
4. **Variable duration**:
   - Do not generate only 1-hour slots. Ensure the generated \`potentialWorkHours\` have a variable duration based on the subject's needs, respecting the time slots available for the teacher.
   
5. **No weekends**:
   - Ensure \`potentialWorkHours\` are not scheduled on Saturdays or Sundays.
   
6. **Teacher availability**:
   - Make sure that \`potentialWorkHours\` are only generated during the teacher's available hours (excluding periods in \`listOfUnavailabilities\`).

### Example Scenario:
- A teacher is available from 10:00 to 18:00 on weekdays (Monday to Friday).
- A subject requires 20 hours of teaching, divided into sessions lasting 1.5â€“3 hours each.
- Teachers are unavailable for certain time slots, and the classroom can only be used during specified school days.
- Based on the input data, generate multiple \`potentialWorkHours\` that respect the constraints, distribute them across several days as indicated in \`schoolWeekClass\`, and ensure no conflicts with existing courses or teacher availability.
