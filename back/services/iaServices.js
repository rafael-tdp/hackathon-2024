      },
      ...
  ]
}

### Input Data:
- **classId**: The ID of the class for whom potential work hours are being generated.
- **listOfUnavailabilities**: A list of time periods during which specific teachers are unavailable.
 [{
	"startTime": "", The starting date and time of the unavailability, in ISO 8601 format (e.g., "2024-12-25T07:27:43.311Z").

}, ...]
- **listOfSchoolClassesDays**: A list of dates. Each date corresponds to a specific day when school classes are scheduled to occur.
[   
 	"2024-12-24T23:00:00.000Z",
	"2024-12-25T23:00:00.000Z",
	"2024-12-26T23:00:00.000Z"
]
- **listOfSubjectsToPlan**: An array of objects specifying the required number of hours for each subject of the teacher's school classes.
[{
	"subject": "", The name of the subject (e.g., "HTML").
	"hoursToPlan": , The total number of hours to be scheduled for this subject (e.g., 40 hours).
	"teachers": [] A list of IDs representing the teachers eligible to teach this subject.
}, ...]
- **listOfPlannedCourses**: A list of already planned courses. Each course contains the following information: 
[{
	"_id": "", A unique identifier for the planned course (e.g., "675cb620377025cb6c72bb38").
	"subject": "", The ID of the subject being taught (e.g., "675cb61c377025cb6c72b803").

### Constraints:
1. **No overlap**:
   - A teacher cannot teach two classes at the same time.
   - A classroom cannot be used by multiple classes simultaneously.
   - The new scheduled hours must not overlap with existing planned courses for the same teacher or classroom.
   
2. **Respect required hours**:
   - Ensure the total number of hours scheduled for each subject per class matches the required hours as specified in \`subjectClass\`.
   
3. **Respect school weeks**:
   - Schedule \`potentialWorkHours\` only within the days and hours defined in \`schoolWeekClass\` (do not schedule outside these periods).
   - Spread the potential work hours across multiple days based on the available days within the \`schoolWeekClass\`, ensuring that courses are not all generated for the same day.
   
4. **Variable duration**:
   - Do not generate only 1-hour slots. Ensure the generated \`potentialWorkHours\` have a variable duration based on the subject's needs, respecting the time slots available for the teacher.
   
5. **No weekends**:
   - Ensure \`potentialWorkHours\` are not scheduled on Saturdays or Sundays.
   
6. **Teacher availability**:
   - Make sure that \`potentialWorkHours\` are only generated during the teacher's available hours (excluding periods in \`listOfUnavailabilities\`).

### Example Scenario:
- A subject requires 20 hours of teaching, divided into sessions lasting 1.5â€“3 hours each.
- Teachers are unavailable for certain time slots, as specified in \`listOfUnavailabilities\`. Any courses scheduled during these periods should be rescheduled.
- School classes are scheduled from Monday to Friday, with no classes on weekends. Courses can be scheduled between 8:00 AM and 6:00 PM and for the days specified in \`listOfSchoolClassesDays\`.
- Any courses can be scheduled if they do not overlap with existing courses for the same teacher or classroom, as specified in \`listOfPlannedCourses\`.
- The teacher can teach multiple subjects, and the total number of hours for each subject must be respected.
- Do not schedule course on days whose date is not in \`listOfSchoolClassesDays\`.

Verify that the generated \`potentialWorkHours\` adhere to the constraints and provide the JSON object as output with the following structure:
